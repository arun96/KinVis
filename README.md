# KinVis
Welcome to KinVis, a visual analytic tool for visualizing Kinship data in Genome-Wide Association Studies.

KinVis is built in R and Shiny, and allows users to import GWAS data, visualize kinship information. Users may view kinship for populations as a whole, as well as kinship between individuals of a single population.

This is a very early version of the application. We will be working on many bug fixes and changes over the coming 1-2 months.
