# KinVis
Welcome to KinVis, a visual analytic tool for visualizing Kinship data in Genome-Wide Association Studies.

KinVis is built in R and Shiny, and allows users to import GWAS data, visualize kinship information. Users may view kinship for populations as a whole, as well as kinship between individuals of a single population.

This is a very early version of the application - there are still bugs that we need to fix. We will be such fixes and changes over the coming 1-2 months.

To run KinVis, download the code files, and run either server.R or app.R in RStudio. In this version, you must have a folder named "DATA" in your working directory, with the files you wish to visualize.
